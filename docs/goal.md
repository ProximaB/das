# Project Goal

* To provide a secure and robust solution to competition organizers and competitors. Currently, the most popular systems do not have the necessary security setup to protect itself from being compromised. Data security is the top priority of this project.

* To provide a free competition management solution to most amateur and collegiate competition organizers. A competition management system should not require a specially-trained technician to be useful for the organizer. Competition organizer’s limited budget should be spent on renting a great venue, inviting unbiased and professional adjudicators, and promote dancesport in society.

* To provide insightful information to competitors, including but not limited to:
  * Dancer and Couple profiles and statistics
  * Dancer and Couple rating, ranking, and progression
  * Adjudicator preference
  
* To help organizers manage competitions efficiently:
  * A more intuitive user interface for all users
  * Small functions that improve quality of life:
    * Set up typical collegiate and amateur competitions quickly
    * Competition finance management: managing entries, tickets, and lessons sales
    * Compatible with major federations’ requirements: WDSF, WDC, USA Dance, NDCA, and Collegiate (North America)
  * TBA partner search and matchmaking

* To provide opportunities for software developers and data enthusiasts:
  * API for developing custom client applications (competition results, statistics, etc.)
  * API for competition data and statistics
